# sample-api-generator
working on frontend first? sample-api-generator is here to help.  Just provide the keys and their types and it generates an api with required format with random values. 


### Just like some paid services, users will have the permission to decide the format of the json in which they want the response in. The only difference will be that it will be absolutely free.

##### Currently being written in Python to figure out how to proceed with the project. Might be written in Golang in the future for better performance.
